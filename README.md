# StitchIt

This project aims to produce a program to convert any digital image into 
a Cross-Stitch pattern with tuneable color palette and size.  The inputs will
be an image file and the desired finished pattern size (in inches or stitches).
The output will be the pattern as well as the color-matched thread counts 
for DMC floss.
